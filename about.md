We aim to provide an in-depth tutorial in the interpretation and visualization of omic data. Among the topics we will cover are: "Genome Browsing and Interpretation", "Differential Expression and Pathway Analysis", "Best in Class tools for visualization". Students should have a background in biology and a basic knowledge of the R programming language and linux.

This resource is structured in a modular format. Users would benefit from familiarity with topics covered in previous modules however it is not a strict requirement unless otherwise stated. Please navigate to Courses to begin.
