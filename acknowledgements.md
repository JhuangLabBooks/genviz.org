Physalia-courses provides scientific training courses and Workshops in Bioinformatics, Genomics and related fields, promoting the transfer of new methods and emerging techniques to a broad range of researchers. Their goal is to build a knowledge-sharing platform between highly qualified instructors and participants at various stage of their scientific and academic career (e.g. PhD students, post-doctoral researchers, PIs). Through the courses and workshops, participants learn how to plan their projects and how to analyze their data.

This work would not be possible without building upon what others have contributed to the bioinformatics community. We would like to thank the authors of the bioinformatic tools and resources upon which this tutorial is based. 

We would also like to thank the following researchers who contributed to lecture or exercise materials:
* Sorana Morrissy - IGV
* Jim Robinson - IGV
* Ben Ainscough - IGV
* Jason Walker - IGV

Finally, we would like to thank the students who participated and contributed in many ways to development of these materials.
