The age of cheap massively parallel sequencing has exponentially increased the availability of genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and other kinds of 'omic profiling. Extracting biologically meaningful results and communicating this information remains challenging. This site aims to expose users to a number of "best-in-class" tools and methods for overcoming this.

We aim to provide an in-depth tutorial in the interpretation and visualization of omic data. Among the topics we will cover are: "Genome Browsing and Interpretation", "Differential Expression and Pathway Analysis", "Best in Class tools for visualization", and others. Students should have a background in biology and a basic knowledge of the R programming language and linux.

This resource is structured in a modular format. Users would benefit from familiarity with topics covered in previous modules however it is not a strict requirement unless otherwise stated. Please navigate to [Course](http://genviz.org/course/) to begin.
