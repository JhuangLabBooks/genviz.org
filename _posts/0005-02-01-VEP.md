Often it will be informative to annotate variants with additional information in order to get a sense of a variants impact on a phenotype. One tool that makes this process quick and straightforward is the ensembl [Variant Effect Predictor](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) VEP. This program is available both as a stand alone software program based in [perl](https://www.perl.org/) and as a web based GUI. In this module we will learn how to use [VEP](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) in it's raw perl form.

### Installing perl
In order to use [VEP](http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) we will first need to download and install [perl](https://www.perl.org/), a high level scripting language. First let's check if you have perl already installed, open a command prompt on your local machine and run the code below. To open a command prompt on mac go to spotlight and search for "terminal". On a windows machine got to "START" and search for the the application "CMD". If your running linux you probably already know how to open a terminal.
```bash
# check perl version
perl -v
```
If you see a message to the effect of "This is perl 5" then you can ignore the next bit, otherwise you will need to download and install perl. To do this navigate to the perl downloads page at [https://www.perl.org/get.html](https://www.perl.org/get.html) and select "get started" for your specific operating system.

Then select activeState perl, once the installer is downloaded follow the on screen instructions and check your install with `perl -v`.
