Brief introduction to ClinVar

[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health. To date, thousands of variants and associated phenotypes have been deposited in ClinVar. The main use case for ClinVar is when you have one or more variants observed in a human sample and you would like to know if these variants have established clinical relevance. The resource is fairly heavily biased towards germline inherited variants that predispose an individual for disease. Many diseases and phenotypes have been reported. Some of the variant observations in ClinVar come from sources that mine published literature (e.g. [DoCM](http://docm.info), [OMiM](https://www.omim.org/), etc.). However, the majority of submissions to ClinVar come from clinical sequencing labs that identify variants in patients and report that variant along with the phenotype of the patient that instigated testing. Several types of variants are supported in ClinVar. Many are single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or small insertions and deletions, but large structural variants are also supported. In general, all variants in ClinVar are designated using the HGVS nomenclature. 

### Basic intro to the ClinVar interface
ClinVar offers a few video tutorials to get you started: [Intro to ClinVar](https://youtu.be/A8G3ej83ZgU) and [Find All Variants with ClinVar](https://youtu.be/H09-0pP48Us). The ClinVar website is quite simple. The [home page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) offers various links to frequently used sections. The tool bar at the top of each page includes the simple search bar and various menus to navigate to additional information.

* To get a sense of where the data in ClinVar is coming from, visit the complete [submitter list](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/submitter_list/) (Statistics -> List of Submitters). This list gives you an idea of some of the major players in the genetic diagnostics and variant interpretation.
* To get a sense of the current content of ClinVar, visit the [Statistics page](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/submitters/) (Statistics -> Statistics).
* If you would like to download raw ClinVar data, you can do so from their [FTP site](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/). For example, you can download the complete set of ClinVar variants in VCF format ([human genome build 37 VCF](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh37/) or [human genome build 38 VCF](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/vcf_GRCh38/)).
