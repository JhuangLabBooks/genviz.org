[COSMIC](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, hosted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, is one of the largest and most comprehensive resources for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer. It is the product of a massive expert data curation effort, presenting data from thousands of publications and many important large scale cancer genomics datasets. COSMIC acts as the main portal for at least four important projects or resources: [COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), the [Cancer Gene Census](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census), the [Cell Lines Project](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines) and [COSMIC-3D](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic3d/). Academic users can use and download (with registration) the data for free, so long as they do not re-distribute the data, and agree to the [license terms](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/license). For-profit users must pay a fee to download COSMIC. These resources provide access to a very rich set of data, visualizations, and interpretations for understanding cancer mutations and cancer genes.

### The COSMIC database
To browse [COSMIC](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) you can simply navigate to the main page and search for a gene, cancer type, mutation, etc in the search box. To illustrate we will explore the results for BRAF.

### The Cancer Gene Census

The [Cancer Gene Census (CGC)](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census) is an ongoing effort to catalogue those genes for which mutations (somatic or germline) have been causally implicated in cancer. The original census and analysis was published in Nature Reviews Cancer by [Futreal et al. 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrc1299) but it continues to receive regular updates. The CGC is widely regarded as a definitive list of cancer genes (tumor suppressors and oncogenes).   

Exercise: Extract a complete list of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes from the Cancer Gene Census.
