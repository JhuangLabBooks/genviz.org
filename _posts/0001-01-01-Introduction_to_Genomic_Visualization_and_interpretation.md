Welcome to the Genomic Visualization and Interpretations tutorial series. The goal of this tutorial is to provide students with the skills necessary to visualize and interpret 'omic' data in various forms. To accomplish this task we will be exploring a number of tools and resources available through the R programming language and via the web providing background where appropriate. We recommend using the navigation links found at the bottom of all course topic pages however students can search for individual topics via the search tab. Exercises to reinforce concepts are interspersed throughout each course topic.
