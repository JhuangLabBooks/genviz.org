The [Ensembl Genome Browser](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) provides a portal to sequence data, gene annotations/predictions, and other types of data hosted in the various Ensembl databases. Many consider the Ensembl to be the most comprehensive and systematic gene annotation resource in the world. They support a large number of species and make data available through a powerful web portal as well as through direct database downloads and APIs. Their excellent [Help & Documentation](http://www.ensembl.org/info/index.html) pages provide excellent instruction on using the website, data access, APIs, and their procedures for gene annotation and prediction. Their outreach team have put together [extensive teaching materials](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/index.html) that are available free online. Rather than duplicate effort, we have linked to some of their instructional videos below. We will review these and then perform some simple exercises to familiarize ourselves with the Ensembl Genome browser.

### Data Visualization with Ensembl

An excellent way to explore the data visualization possibilities with Ensembl is to use their [Find a Data Display](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/gallery.html) page. This is linked directly from the [Ensembl home page](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html)(see red box below). From this page, you can you can choose a gene, region or variant and then browse a selection of relevant visualisations.

Navigate to the [Find a Data Display](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/gallery.html) page. To illustrate, select 'Species' -> 'Human', 'Feature Type' -> 'Genes', and then 'Identifier' -> 'TP53'. You will be presented with a number of possible matches. Select the exact 'TP53' match and select 'Go'. The results page, at time of writing, returned a comprehensive set of 47 views for TP53 (ENSG00000141510) associated with: Sequence & Structure, Expression & Regulation, Transcripts & Proteins, Comparative Genomics, and Variants. We will display just a few examples here and then explore others through exercises.

### Ensembl Data Display Exercises

Using your knowledge of tissue-specific expression for a specific species/gene, explore the Gene Expression views in Ensembl. Does the available data confirm your knowledge of these genes. For example, considering human genes, we might investigate: MSLN (Mesothelin) - normally present on the mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium and over-expressed in several cancers. Other interesting human/cancer tissue markers include: PSA, EPCAM, SCGB2A2 (Mammaglobin), etc.
