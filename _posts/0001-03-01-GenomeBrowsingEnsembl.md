The [Ensembl Genome Browser](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) provides a portal to sequence data, gene annotations/predictions, and other types of data hosted in the various Ensembl databases. Many consider the Ensembl to be the most comprehensive and systematic gene annotation resource in the world. They support a large number of species and make data available through a powerful web portal as well as through direct database downloads and APIs. Their excellent [Help & Documentation](http://www.ensembl.org/info/index.html) pages provide excellent instruction on using the website, data access, APIs, and their procedures for gene annotation and prediction. Their outreach team have put together [extensive teaching materials](http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/index.html) that are available free online. Rather than duplicate effort, we have linked to some of their instructional videos below. We will review these and then perform some simple exercises to familiarize ourselves with the Ensembl Genome browser.
