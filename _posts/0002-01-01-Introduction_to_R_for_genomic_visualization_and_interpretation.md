R is a rich language full of many packages and algorithms in the disciplines of statistics and bioinformatics to aid in the analysis and interpretation of biological data. In addition R has an extensive graphics library and has a diverse and vibrant community of developers, statisticians, and bioinformaticians. For these reasons this course will heavily focus on using R as the preferred environment for understanding the biological data we are interested in. In this module we will introduce the R language and a few of the graphics libraries within R.

### Goals
* Be able to use R for basic data manipulation.
* Be able to create publication quality graphs to display data.
* Be able to create interactive graphics
* Be familiar with GenVisR, a graphical library for cohort visualization.
