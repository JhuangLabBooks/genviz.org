Precision medicine refers to the use of prevention and treatment strategies that are tailored to the unique features of each individual and their disease. In the context of cancer this might involve the identification of specific mutations shown to predict response to a targeted therapy. The biomedical literature describing these associations is large and growing rapidly. Currently these interpretations exist largely in private or encumbered databases resulting in extensive repetition of effort. Realizing precision medicine will require this information to be centralized, debated and interpreted for application in the clinic. [CIViC](https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/home) is an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer. Its goal is to enable precision medicine by providing an educational forum for dissemination of knowledge and active discussion of the clinical significance of cancer genome alterations. For more details refer to the 2017 [CIViC publication](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v49/n2/full/ng.3774.html) in Nature Genetics.
